Installation
-----------
First, you'll need to make some slight changes to two HTML files to customize
this site to display the proper sales information.  

	index.html
	contactform.html

Open the two HTML files in your favorite text editor, and use the search and
replace text function to look for the following variables (including the leading and trailing # symbols):

	#DOMAIN_URL# 
	Example: www.domain.com
	Do not insert the http:// header, it will break the page and forms.
	
	#ASKING_PRICE#
	Example:  $9,000
	Include the currency symbol of choice.  You might have to use &yen;, &euro; 
	or &pound; instead of $.
	
	#YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS#
	Example: my@domain.ext
	This is where email requests on the site will be directed.
	It is plainly visible in the javascript code, but is usually ignored 
	by web crawlers.

Replace them with your details.  Save the files, open and test in your local
browser.  If everything looks OK, install it on your web server and point the
domain at that folder.

Email queries will be directed to you directly.  You'll need to prime the form
by visiting and submitting dummy information first.  Then verify the form via
an email you'll get, then future queries on this domain will be directed
straight to your email.

The HTML page is wickedly simple, feel free to edit any of the copy to suit your needs, or help convince browsers that your cool domain is their new baby!
